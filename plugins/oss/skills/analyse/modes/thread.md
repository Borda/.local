# Mode: Thread Analysis (Issue, Discussion, or PR)

All three = GitHub conversation threads — same analysis structure, different API fetch. `TYPE` set by auto-detection in SKILL.md (`issue`, `discussion`, or `pr`). `NUMBER` = item number (strip `discussion ` prefix if present)

<workflow>

<!-- Agent Resolution: canonical table at plugins/oss/skills/_shared/agent-resolution.md -->

## Agent Resolution

<!-- `_OSS_SHARED` and `FOUNDRY_SHARED` set by parent analyse/SKILL.md — reload from TMPDIR (fresh shell) -->

```bash
_OSS_SHARED=$(cat "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/analyse-oss-shared" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
cat "$_OSS_SHARED/agent-resolution.md"  # timeout: 5000
```

Contains: foundry check + fallback table. If foundry not installed: use table to substitute each `foundry:X` with `general-purpose`. Agents this skill uses: `foundry:sw-engineer`, `foundry:qa-specialist`.

**Cache check first**: if `$CACHE_FILE` exists — set by parent `analyse/SKILL.md` Cache layer; see that file for keying convention — read `item` and `comments` from it — skip primary fetch. Still run wide-net searches (never cached). For PRs: `gh pr checks` and `gh pr diff` never cached — always live.

On cache miss, run all fetches in parallel:

```bash
# --- run these in parallel ---

if [ "$TYPE" = "issue" ]; then

    gh issue view $NUMBER --json number,title,body,labels,comments,createdAt,author,state  # timeout: 6000
    gh issue view $NUMBER --comments  # timeout: 6000
    # After both complete: write cache (see SKILL.md Cache layer write pattern)

elif [ "$TYPE" = "pr" ]; then

    gh pr view $NUMBER --json number,title,body,labels,reviews,statusCheckRollup,files,additions,deletions,commits,author  # timeout: 6000
    gh pr checks $NUMBER           # never cached — always live  # timeout: 15000
    gh pr diff $NUMBER --name-only # never cached — always live  # timeout: 6000
    # After pr view completes: write cache (see SKILL.md Cache layer write pattern)

else # discussion

    gh api graphql -f query='
    query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
      repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
        discussion(number: $number) {
          title body createdAt closed closedAt
          author { login }
          category { name }
          answer { body author { login } createdAt }
          comments(first: 50) {
            pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
            nodes { body author { login } createdAt }
          }
          labels(first: 10) { nodes { name } }
        }
      }
    }' -f owner='{owner}' -f repo='{repo}' -F number=$NUMBER
    # If query returns null → print "⚠ Discussions not enabled or #N not found" and stop
    # Pagination: if comments.pageInfo.hasNextPage is true, paginate using `after: "<endCursor>"` until hasNextPage is false.
    # Cap at 200 total comments; if thread exceeds 200, note in Summary: "⚠ Thread has >200 comments — analysis based on first 200."
    # After complete: write cache (see SKILL.md Cache layer write pattern)

## Reproduction Check

Run immediately after data fetch, before producing report. Applies to **issues and discussions only** (skip for PRs — Completeness checklist covers reproduction intent).

### Step R1: Detect reproducible example

Scan thread body and all comments for any of:

- `Steps to Reproduce`, `Minimal Reproduction`, `MRE`, `Repro`, or similar section headings
- Fenced code blocks with executable code (Python, shell, YAML, etc.)
- Explicit input → output examples or stack traces with triggering call sites
- Attached config files or test scripts

Set `HAS_REPRO=true` if any found; `HAS_REPRO=false` otherwise.

### Step R2: Sensitive pattern scan

Scan body and all comments for sensitive patterns. **Flag presence only — never include actual values in report.**

| Pattern class | Signals to detect |
| --- | --- |
| Credentials / tokens | `sk-`, `ghp_`, `Bearer `, PEM block headers, hex strings > 40 chars assigned to `key`/`token`/`secret` |
| PII in sample data | Email addresses, phone numbers, full names embedded in data payloads |
| Internal infrastructure | Private domain names (`.internal`, `.corp`, non-public TLDs), S3/GCS bucket paths with internal prefixes, database DSNs |
| Model / experiment internals | Private checkpoint paths, internal model registry URLs, internal W&B run IDs |

Set `SENSITIVE_FLAGS=()` array; add one entry per class found (e.g., `"credentials"`, `"pii"`, `"internal_infra"`, `"model_internals"`).

### Step R3: Spawn agent (only when `HAS_REPRO=true`)

Extract minimal reproduction code or steps from thread. Bind `REPRO_AGENT` — **default `foundry:sw-engineer`**; switch only on explicit signal. Never leave `subagent_type` to tool default (`general-purpose`): unbound spawn silently downgrades to generic agent, which then spawns generic children (it has `Agent` tool; `foundry:sw-engineer` does not) — cascade of non-specialist agents on code.

- Code uses pytest / unittest / Python testing patterns → `REPRO_AGENT=foundry:qa-specialist`
- Everything else (general Python / CLI / config / ambiguous / no code) → `REPRO_AGENT=foundry:sw-engineer` (default)

> Foundry absent (per **Agent Resolution** above): `REPRO_AGENT=general-purpose` and prepend the `foundry:sw-engineer` role prefix from `agent-resolution.md` to the prompt. This is the **only** path to `general-purpose`.

Issue the spawn as a literal bound call — `subagent_type` **must** be the `REPRO_AGENT` value, never inferred (all context self-contained — runs in forked context):

```text
Agent(subagent_type="<REPRO_AGENT>", description="Reproduce issue #<NUMBER>", prompt="""
<the reproduction prompt below>
""")
```

Reproduction prompt:

```markdown
Attempt to reproduce the issue in GitHub #<NUMBER>.

Extracted reproduction steps/code from the thread:
---
<paste the minimal code or steps verbatim>
---

Check:
1. Does the issue reproduce as described?
2. What Python / library version or environment is required?
3. Is anything missing or ambiguous (imports, data, config)?

Return ONLY a compact JSON envelope — nothing else:
{"status":"reproduced|not_reproduced|partial|missing_context","confidence":0.N,"notes":"<one observation max 15 words>","missing":"<what is missing, or null>"}
```

Collect JSON envelope. `REPRO_STATUS` = `status` field.

### Step R4: Build the Reproduction block

Populate `Repro` and `Sensitive` fields in `---` terminal summary block and `Repro validation`/`Repro missing` lines in `## Thread` metadata.

## Stale-symbol check (issues/discussions only — optional, codemap)

Skip for PRs (their diffs already name live files). Optional structural signal — degrades silently-but-flagged when codemap absent.

> loads: codemap-signals.md

```bash
_OSS_ANALYSE=$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/borda-ai-rig/oss/*/skills/analyse 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)  # timeout: 5000
[ -z "$_OSS_ANALYSE" ] && _OSS_ANALYSE="plugins/oss/skills/analyse"
cat "$_OSS_ANALYSE/modes/codemap-signals.md"  # timeout: 5000
```

Run its **Detect** block, then **Signal A** (loaded above). From thread body + comments, extract candidate identifiers (dotted modules + backtick/import/traceback symbols, project-internal only, cap 8), write them one-per-line to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/analyse-triage-candidates.txt` before running Signal A's batch fence. Run existence-check, set `STALE_ISSUE`. When `STALE_ISSUE=true`: list missing identifiers + suggested renames under `### Analysis`, add `stale-symbols` to `### Suggested Labels`. When `CM_ENABLED=false`: emit one-line inline flag from codemap-signals.md into report (don't block).

Run `mkdir -p .reports/analyse/thread` then write full report to `.reports/analyse/thread/output-analyse-thread-$NUMBER-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` using Write tool — **do not print full analysis to terminal**.

```bash
# Reload FOUNDRY_SHARED (Check 41: fresh shell)
FOUNDRY_SHARED=$(cat "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/analyse-foundry-shared" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
[ -f "$FOUNDRY_SHARED/terminal-summaries.md" ] && cat "$FOUNDRY_SHARED/terminal-summaries.md"  # timeout: 5000
```
Compact terminal summary template (loaded above). File absent → warn: "run /foundry:setup — printing plain terminal output instead." Use **Issue Summary** template. Replace `[skill-specific path]` with `.reports/analyse/thread/output-analyse-thread-$NUMBER-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`, ensure block opens with `---` on own line, entity line follows next line, `→ saved to <path>` line present at end, block closes with `---` on own line after it. Print terminal block: read '---' header from top of report file (lines 1–7 up to and including closing '---'), append '→ saved to <path>', print to terminal. Report file already contains block — no separate prepend step needed

**⛔ DO NOT STOP — `REPLY_MODE=true`**: Skip Confidence block here — emitted in SKILL.md Step 6 after reply, or as last step of SKILL.md if not in reply mode. Proceed **immediately** to "Draft contributor reply" section in SKILL.md (Step 7). Response not complete until shepherd spawned and reply file written.

<notes>

- **Cache check**: `$CACHE_FILE` keyed per item number — always set by parent SKILL.md before mode file executes; never fetch on cache hit
- **Discussion pagination cap**: 200-comment limit is safety rail; threads >200 exceptional; always note cap in Summary if hit
- **Sensitive pattern scan**: flag presence only, never include actual values — GDPR/PII risk; if `"credentials"` flagged, add advisory to Suggested Response
- **Reproduction agent**: default `foundry:sw-engineer`; `qa-specialist` only on pytest patterns. Bind `subagent_type` in the literal `Agent()` call — never let it default to `general-purpose` (unbound spawn downgrades + cascades generic children). Don't spawn if `HAS_REPRO=false`
