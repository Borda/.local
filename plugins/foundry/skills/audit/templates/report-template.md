Output complete audit summary. List each audited file by name in `### Files Audited` — from Step 2 inventory; counts alone insufficient.

Audit — .claude/ config
Date:     [YYYY-MM-DD]
Scope:    [N agents, N skills, N rules, N hooks]
Focus:    [config quality audit — agents / skills / routing / all]
Agents:   foundry:curator, foundry:challenger (adversarial mode only)
Outcome:  CLEAN | NEEDS_ATTENTION | BLOCKED
Findings: [N] security · [N] critical · [N] high · [N] medium · [N] low
Confidence: [aggregate score from agent Confidence blocks]
Next steps: /foundry:init (sync clean config) | fix findings → re-run /foundry:audit
Path:       → .reports/audit/<timestamp>/report.md

## Audit Complete — .claude/ config

### Files Audited
- **Agents** (N): name-1, name-2, ...
- **Skills** (N): name-1, name-2, ...
- **Rules** (N): name-1, name-2, ...
- **Hooks** (N): file-1.js, file-2.js, ...
- **Settings**: settings.json
- **Communication** (if in scope): communication.md, quality-gates.md, TEAM_PROTOCOL.md, file-handoff-protocol.md

### Security Findings

> Omit section entirely when no security findings present.

| Severity | ID | File | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `security/critical` | C37-1 | `hooks/foo.js` | Hardcoded API key on line 12 | Remove; use env var `$MY_KEY` |
| `security/high` | C35-1 | `skills/bar/SKILL.md` | Unquoted `$ARGUMENTS` in bash block | Route via parse_scan_args.py |

**Required action before any `/foundry:init` or merge**: resolve all security findings — they are not deferred to "fix all" queue.

### Findings
| Severity | Found | Fixed | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| security | N | N | 0 |
| critical | N | N | 0 |
| high | N | N | 0 |
| medium | N | N | 0 |
| low | N | N ("Fix all" only) | N |

**Fix convergence**: Converged in N pass(es) — 0 fixable findings remain.
```

Or if limit hit:

```markdown
**Fix convergence**: ⚠ CONVERGENCE LIMIT reached (5 passes) — N fixable findings remain (see Remaining section).
```

(Omit fix convergence line when user picked "skip" from gate — only shown when fix option chosen.)

```markdown
### Fixes Applied

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| agents/foo.md | Replaced broken ref `old-agent` → `correct-agent` |

### Remaining (low/nits — auto-fixed only with 'fix all'; otherwise manual review optional)

- [low findings that were not auto-fixed]
- [any infinite loops flagged for user decision]

### Code Block Similarity

Include when `$RUN_DIR/similarity-check33.md` exists (`--efficiency` mode only). Read the file and embed both tables verbatim — do NOT summarize. Label:

```markdown
#### Purpose-based similarity clusters — Check 33 / --efficiency only
<Table 1 from similarity-check33.md verbatim>
<Table 2 from similarity-check33.md verbatim>
```

Omit section entirely if `similarity-check33.md` absent (efficiency not active or no clusters found).

### Agent Confidence

| File | Score | Label | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| agents/foo.md | 0.92 | high | — |
| skills/bar/SKILL.md | 0.64 | ⚠ low | no runtime data for bash validation |

Low-confidence files re-audited: N | Still uncertain after retry: N (see gaps above)

### Next Step

Run `/foundry:init` to propagate clean config to ~/.claude/

```
